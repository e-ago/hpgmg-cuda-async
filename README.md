# HPGMG-FV CUDA Async

[HPGMG](https://hpgmg.org) is an HPC benchmarking effort and supercomputing ranking metric based on geometric multigrid methods. NVIDIA reworked the original implementation moving from a CPU implementation to an [hybrid CPU-GPU solution](https://bitbucket.org/nsakharnykh/hpgmg-cuda).
In this repository, starting from the NVIDIA solution, we leverage the communications with [GPUDirect Async](https://github.com/gpudirect/libgdsync), recently released by NVIDIA.
